# PY STFT
Original from https://www.swharden.com/wp/2010-06-19-simple-python-spectrograph-with-pygame/
I liked the idea of using pygame with the scipy fft.

Attempting to clean up the code and some command line options:
* TODO sample frequency
* TODO window size
* TODO skip size
* TODO windowing function
